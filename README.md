# Protein_Image_Classification
Proteins are present in every human cell and are required for structure, function, and regulation of the body's tissues and organs. High throughput imaging of cells has provided a wealth of image data and driven a need for classification of proteins in cells without the need for human intervention. 

In this project, I used image data from Kaggle and The Human Protein Atlas (https://www.proteinatlas.org/) to attempt to classify proteins using Random Forest and Convolutional Neural Network models.
